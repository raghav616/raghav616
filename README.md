# Document Query App/ Query Document Finder

## Overview

The Document Query App is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload PDF files, text files, or provide URLs to extract and query textual content. The app uses the LangChain framework for text processing and the OpenAI API for querying and generating responses.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload PDF files or text files.
- **URL Input**: Users can provide a URL from which the app will fetch and extract text.
- **Querying**: Users can input a query to search the extracted text and receive responses based on the provided content.

## Requirements

To run this application, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - `streamlit`
  - `PyPDF2`
  - `langchain-openai`
  - `langchain-community`
  - `typing-extensions`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `faiss-cpu`
  - `requests`

You can install the required packages using pip:

## Troubleshooting :-

- Ensure that your .env file contains a valid OpenAI API key.
- Make sure you have an active internet connection, as the app needs to fetch and query data from OpenAI.
